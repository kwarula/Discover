## Transport Feature Details

### Visual Display
When users request bodabodas or tuktuks, the system displays:
1. **Map View**: Interactive map showing:
   - User's current location (blue marker)
   - Available bodabodas (orange markers with üèçÔ∏è)
   - Available tuktuks (yellow markers with üõ∫)
   - Selected transport details overlay
   - Map legend for clarity

2. **Card List**: Below the map, transport options are displayed as cards showing:
   - Driver name and photo
   - Vehicle number
   - Rating (star rating)
   - Distance from user
   - Estimated arrival time
   - Fare estimate
   - Call and Book buttons

### Technical Implementation
- Google Maps integration for map display
- Real-time location tracking
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Proper error handling for location permissions

## API Integration
The chat interface now expects the webhook to return rich content in the following format for transport:

```typescript
{
  text: "Here are the available transport options near you:",
  richContent: {
    type: 'transports',
    data: Transport[], // Array of transport objects
    userLocation?: { lat: number; lng: number }
  }
}
```

### Performance Optimizations

- No runtime style calculations
- Efficient prop updates

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Automatic grid adjustments

## Setup Requirements

   ```

2. **Environment Variables**: Ensure all necessary environment variables are configured
